# AstroMachineLearning9506S

This is a machine learning project required for the completion of the AstroMachine Learning course at The University of Wester Ontario.

My code is an astronomical classifier based on multi-band photometry.

One of the main problems with big-data astronomical observations for surveys is the need to classify objects based on imaging, which requires little time but lacks precision. A more precise method for unresolved sources such as quasars/star-like objects is spectrum analysis, which takes a long time.

This code uses visible photometry (bands UBVRI from the SDSS) in supervised and unsupervised methods to classify 100000 objects with high precision.
